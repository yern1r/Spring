AOP - paradigm of programming, based on dividing the main and serv functions.

Serv functional writes into Aspect classes
Aspect class uses cross-cutting logic

cross-cutting logic:
-loging/security check/обработка транзакций/обработка исключений/Кэширование

Before the main methods execution, aspect class will be executed

Advantages;
- focus on one or more обособленных классах. It allows to easily change
- It is easy to add new cross-cutting logicfor our main code because of configuration aspects
- business code will be less and clear, after using cross-cutting logic

disadvantage:
- More time for work , execution of aspects
